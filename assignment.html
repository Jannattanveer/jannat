<dd>THERE WAS ONCE a very rich merchant who had three daughters.  Being a man of sense, he spared no cost for their education. His daughters grew to be very beautiful but the first two daughters cared little about 
 their learning.  The youngest was called Beauty, a special name that made her sisters very jealous of her, but this she hardly noticed as she was forever absorbed in one good book or another.<br>

The two elder sisters had a great deal of pride because they were rich. They gave themselves ridiculous airs, and would not visit other merchants' daughters, nor keep company with any persons but those of the highest standing. 
They went out every day to parties, balls, plays, concerts, and so forth, and they laughed at their youngest sister who spent so much of her time with a book in front of her face.</dd>

<br><dd>One day the merchant learned terrible news - his ship that had on board hundreds of bolts of cloth and silks he had purchased, was lost at sea.  Overnight, his entire fortune vanished!<br>

The family had no choice but to move to a small country house at a great distance from town.  The merchant told his children with tears in his eyes that they must live there and work for their living The two older daughters 
answered that they would never have to leave the town, for they had several prominent merchants who they were sure would be glad to marry them, though they no longer had a fortune. But the good ladies were mistaken,
 for their lovers slighted and forsook them in their poverty. As they were not liked on account of their pride, everybody said: They do not deserve to be pitied, we are very glad to see their pride humbled.
  Let them go and give themselves quality airs in milking the cows and minding their chickens, like the rest of us. But, added they, we are extremely concerned for Beauty.  She is such a sweet-tempered creature who speaks kindly to
 everyone rich or poor, and has such a friendly, gracious nature.The family had no choice but to move to a small country house at a great distance from town.</dd>
<hr>
<dd>When the family moved to their country house, the merchant applied himself to farming. Beauty rose at four in the morning before the others awoke and made haste to light the fire, clean the house, and prepare breakfast for 
the family. In the beginning she found the work very difficult for she was not used to this sort of hard labor.  But in less than two months, she grew stronger and healthier than ever. After she had done her chores, Beauty read a book,
 played the harpsichord, or sung while she spun yarn.

Her two sisters, on the other hand, did not know how to spend their time. They got up at ten and did nothing but saunter about the whole day, lamenting the loss of their fine clothes and acquaintances. "Look at our youngest sister,"
 they snickered to each other. "See how well-suited she is to a life of menial labor."</dd>

<dd>The family had lived about a year in the country house when the merchant received stunning news in a letter. The ship that the merchant was sure had been lost at sea had, in fact, safely arrived at port! The family rejoiced
 in this sudden turn of fortune. When the two older daughters saw their father ready to set out to claim his lost ship, one begged him to bring back for her a necklace of gems, the other demanded a thick golden chain, and Beauty
 asked only for a rose.</dd>
<br>
<img src="1 letter.jpg",alt="beauty and the beast"<br>
<dd>The good man set off on his journey. When he came to where the ship was docked, oh such problems there were over who properly owned the ship and the merchandise on board.  After a great deal of trouble and pains to no purpose,
 he came back as poor as before, especially after he bought the fine new necklace and the gold chain he had promised to his two older daughters. Thinking he might come upon a rosebush to satisfy the wish of his youngest daughter, 
he led his horse deep into the woods.<br>

As the sun set and the wind began to howl, the poor man realized that he was hopelessly lost. Worse, a sudden rain storm drenched him and then a snow storm struck.  He knew he might well starve to death from the cold or hunger,
 or be devoured by the wolves, whom he heard howling all round him. Then, looking far off into the distance, he saw a small light blinking. Going on a little farther, he noticed it came from a palace lit with candles from top 
to bottom.

<br>
<dd>The merchant hastened to the palace and was greatly surprised at not meeting anyone in the outer courts. Seeing a large stable open, he led his horse inside.  Finding both hay and oats, the poor beast, who was almost famished,
 fell to eating very heartily. The merchant tied him safely to a post and walked towards the house, where he still saw no one. Entering a large hall, he found a good fire and a table set out with plenty of steaming food. Someone must
 live here in the house, he thought, but who? And where were they? He drew near the fire to dry his soaked  clothes. "I hope," he thought, "the master of this house or his servants will excuse the liberty I take. I am sure it will not
 be long before some of them appear."<br>

Someone must live in the house, he thought, but who? And where were they?<br>

He waited a considerable time until the clock struck eleven, and still nobody came.  At last the merchant was so hungry that he could stand it no longer.  Trembling, he took a leg of chicken and ate it in two mouthfuls. After this he
 drank a few glasses of wine. Growing more courageous, he went out of the hall and crossed through several grand rooms with magnificent furniture, until he came to a bedroom. In the middle of the room was a four-poster bed covered by 
a red velvet canopy draped with fringes.  As he was very tired and it was past midnight, he concluded it was best to shut the door and go to sleep.</dd>

<dd>It was ten the next morning before the merchant awoke. As he rose, he was astonished to see a good suit of clothes laid out on the bed that would fit him perfectly. This palace must belong to some kind fairy, he thought, who has 
seen and pitied my distress. He then returned to the great hall where he had supped the night before, and found a mug of hot chocolate ready made on a little table. "Thank you, good Madam Fairy," said he aloud, "for being so careful
 as to provide me a breakfast. I am extremely obliged to you for all your favors."<br>

The good man drank his chocolate and then went to look for his horse.  Passing through an arbor of roses he remembered Beauty's request to him, and gathered one from a branch on which were several. Immediately he heard a great crash 
like thunder.  Spinning around, there loomed a huge monster!  With two tusks in his mouth, fiery red eyes surrounded by bristles, and horns coming out of its head and spreading over its back, the beast roared: "Mortal! Who said you can 
pluck my rose?"<br>
"Mortal!  Who said you can pluck my rose?"<br>

"Please, sir!" said the merchant in fear and terror for his life. "I promised my daughter to bring her home a rose and forgot about it till the last moment.  Then I saw your beautiful garden and thought you would not miss a single rose,
 or else I would have asked your permission."

"You are a thief!" boomed the beast. "You must give your life for this crime!"<br>

The merchant fell on his knees and begged for his life for the sake of his three daughters who had none but he to support them. "My lord," said he, "I beseech you to forgive me!  Indeed, I had no intention to offend in gathering a rose
 for one of my daughters, who asked only for that from my travels."</dd>
